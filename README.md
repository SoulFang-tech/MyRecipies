# Omurice
Omurice is a popular contemporary Japanese fusion creation blending Western omelette and Japanese fried rice. It’s usually enjoyed at home but also can be found at many Western food diners in Japan. When there is leftover rice, it’s a perfect single plate meal to prepare the next day.

The rice is usually pan-fried with ketchup and chicken, then wrapped in a thin sheet of egg omelette. From preparation to completion only takes a quick 20 minutes. It’s one of my children’s favorite meals with fried rice, eggs, and lots of ketchup.

The softly-cooked omelette and sweet tomato-flavored rice complements each other very well, so I hope you will enjoy this quick and easy recipe!
